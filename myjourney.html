<h4>ðŸ”¥MY JOURNEYðŸ”¥</h4>
    <p> <br>
        I used to study at Boonwattana School in Nakhon Ratchasima Province. My best journey at present is from high school. It was a good time. I tried many things with my friends. I became an athlete and competed continuously since I was 12 years old. Now, at 18, I still do it. I also made a band with my friends. I also practiced making music and had songs with my friends. I also went out to party with my friends. I also had a girlfriend and she was the one who helped me in everything, whether it was good or bad. She was still with me until now. In the last period of high school, I read a lot of books, so I didn't go out much. It made me still think about that time.
